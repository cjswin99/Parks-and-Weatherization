*As a user:
  I am planning to take my family or group of friends on a trip to a National Park.

  I would like to find a website or app on my phone that tells me locations of National Parks, either near me or by region.
    -When i land on the site/app I am presented with a welcome page that asks if I am looking for a Park near me, or choose by state.
      --If I choose near me, it asks what state I am in. If I select by state, it asks what state I would like to search.
    -When I answer with my selection, I am given 3 (or more) options to choose from in that state and can view in greater detail.

  When I find the Location/s I am interested in, I would like to know what the weather is forcasted to be while I am there.
    -When I click on the locations of interest for a detailed overview, there is an option to check the weather forcast in the Parks area.
    -When I click on the 'Check Weather' It redirects me to a 3-5 day weather forcast specific to that parks area.

  **As an added perk**

  When I find out the weather condition for the area, there is a notification on the page asking me if I would like to prepare for the weather.
    -When I click on the notification I am offered the ability to purchase ++ a shade/rain tarp pop-up kit. ++
        (can be modified to add/remove/delete additional items to and from inventory)
